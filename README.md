# 05-Successful-Sexual-Activity

This project is an attempt to <b>model successful sexual activity over the course of the year</b>. While it is widely known that there is increased sexual activity in the winter (which leades to more birthdays in late summer), we also hypothesize that there might be a "Valentine Baby Boom," as there seems to be quite a lot of birthdays in late November as well. Using Bayesian statistics and data from multiple sources, we did find a slight bump in sexual activity during Valentine's day, but probably not as large as we expected.
